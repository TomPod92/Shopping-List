## About the App

It allows the user to add a product to shop (to specific section).
Apart from that you can add as many product to your shopping list or delete them from the shop.
In the "lista zakupow" tab you can brows through that shopping list and mark each products as bought or delete it from the list.
All three tabs were made using React Router.
